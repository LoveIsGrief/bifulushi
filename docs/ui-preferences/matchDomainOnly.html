# Matching urls by domain only

A URL is made up of `scheme://domain/path`.

When this preference is enabled, only the domain part of the URL will be used for matching.

## Example

`https://duckduckgo.com/search?q=your search query` has
 - scheme: `https`
 - domain: `duckduckgo.com`
 - path: `search`

Say we have the pattern `search`, since we want every search URL to be put into a container.

**Full match**

The pattern will match the _path_ and the URL will be put into a container.

**Domain only**

The pattern will **not** match and an attempt at finding another container will be made.

# Warning

You will most likely have to rewrite your patterns when switching the preference!
Matching behavior **will** change!
